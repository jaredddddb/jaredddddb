### Name is Jared Briones, but Jared is fine. SWCTA junior game development student in the Class of 2025 (man it's going fast). I also like games too I guess.
Based around Las Vegas, NV

My interests in Game Development include wanting to learn more about game-making programs like Unity, Unreal Engine, Gamemaker, and maybe even Roblox if I feel like it. I also want to learn more about the many kinds of roles in game-making and see what aspects I do the best on. I'm also interested in testing games I can play in class that can bypass the school system. As of now, I'm currently coming up with ideas to develop a future game for a class project. In the future, I hope I can learn more about coding languages like Java, C, or Python and have some sort of variety in making my games. 
silly man
